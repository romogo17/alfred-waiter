Simple mobile app to order food from your restaurant table. Stop waiting for the waiter to arrive!

This repository contains both the API server and the mobile app.

The API is built on top of [LoopBack](https://loopback.io/) and the mobile app is made with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

## Run the Mobile App

1. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) installed
2. Install the `expo-cli` globally

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

3. Clone this repository and navigate to it
4. Navigate to the app directory

```bash
cd app
```

5. Install the required dependecies. You only need to perform this step when you clone the repository

```bash
npm install
```

6. Run the app

```bash
npm start
```

7. Follow the on-screen instructions to run the app either on the Expo Client or through an emulator in your development environment
